# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Backend-Demo Docker Image CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
    # pull_request:
    # branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Login to Azure Container Registry
        # https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#provide-a-password-using-stdin
        run: echo ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }} | docker login -u ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} --password-stdin
      - name: Get the version
        id: vars
        run: echo ::set-output name=tag::$(echo ${GITHUB_REF:10})
      - name: Build the tagged Docker image
        run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag backend-demo/spring-boot:${{steps.vars.outputs.tag}}
      - name: Push the tagged Docker image
        run: docker push backend-demo/spring-boot:${{steps.vars.outputs.tag}}
      - name: Build the latest Docker image
        run: docker build . --file Dockerfile --tag backend-demo/spring-boot:latest
      - name: Push the latest Docker image
        run: docker push backend-demo/spring-boot:latest
